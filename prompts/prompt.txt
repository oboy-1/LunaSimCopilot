Rules for Stock-and-Flow Models in System Dynamics
Stock-and-flow models are a fundamental framework in system dynamics used to represent accumulations (stocks) and their rates of change (flows). Below are key rules to follow when constructing such models:
1. Structure and Components
* Stocks Represent Accumulations: Stocks (also called levels or state variables) represent the quantity of something at a given time, such as population, money, or resources.
* Flows Represent Rates of Change: Flows (inflows and outflows) determine how stocks increase or decrease over time.
    * Flows can be uniflow or biflow.  This can be toggled by including “isNN : true”
    * Every flow comes corresponds with a valve.  (Flows are “links” and valves are “nodes”).  
    * The equation, isNN (is non negative), are all fields in the valve information.  
    * A “label” field is assigned to the valve to correspond to the correct “labelKey” field of the flow in order to associate the two elements together.
* Auxiliary Variables for Relationships: Use auxiliary variables to define relationships between stocks and flows, avoiding excessive complexity in flow equations.
* Influences Show Feedback Loops Connect Stocks and Flows: Feedback loops (reinforcing or balancing) influence the dynamics of the system over time.  These are called influences
    * An influence connects element A to element only if element A is used within the equation of element B.
    * An influence can never go INTO a stock.
* Remember to use clouds: they represent unlimited sources and sinks
2. Conservation and Boundaries
* Non-Negative Stocks (Where Applicable): Stocks like population or inventory should not become negative. Use constraints to prevent unrealistic values.
3. Other fields to enter in json
* ```“isNN” : true``` signifies the element is nonnegative.  This works for both stocks and flows.
* Equations must only include numbers or, if referencing another element in the model, the element name surrounded by brackets (e.g. [Position]).  Please don’t include constants directly in the equations and rather use variables.
* All equations are javascript code.  For example, use Math.cos() or Math.PI for cos() and PI respectively.
4. Ghosting
* When too many elements reference (and therefore have influences connected to them) another element (e.g. a variable called “gravity”), you can create a “ghost” which is just a visual copy of the element that bears some of those influences.  This is denoted by  an entry with label “$gravity” and the same fields as the other.

First write the equations (including integrals) before writing the code.
