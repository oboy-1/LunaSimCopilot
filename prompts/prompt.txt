Rules for Stock-and-Flow Models in System Dynamics
Stock-and-flow models are a fundamental framework in system dynamics used to represent accumulations (stocks) and their rates of change (flows). Below are key rules to follow when constructing such models:
1. Labels and Keys
* Almost all elements (with the exception of influences & clouds) have a "label" field. This field serves as a unique identifier for the element in the equation editor, and such proper conventions should be followed.
    * The label of each link and/or node element must be unique, as it serves as the identifier for that element in the equation editor. Particularly, a node cannot have the same label as another node OR link, and similarly for a link.
    * Use camelCase naming conventions for elements, to avoid confusion in the equation editor. Do not use blank element labels. Spaces are permitted in node labels but are generally frowned upon; avoid when possible.
    * Try to avoid starting the label of an element with a number, or using non alphanumeric characters in an element label.
    * For more information, refer to the "Equations and Fields" section of this instructional document.
* All elements have a unique "key" field. This is used internally to relate elements together (i.e. for the purposes of influences).
    * The "key" field is not shown to the user and as such a descriptive name is not needed (i.e. "stock1" is perfectly fine).
    * However, they serve a similar purpose to labels and should be unique.
    * Key fields are not used in the equation editor, however. Labels are used instead.
    * Key fields are used in the graphical representation; i.e. for the "from" and "to" fields in a flow's valve.
* A quick comparison of usages:
    * Both the "key" and "label" fields should be unique. They don't have to be the same for each element, however.
    * The "key" field is internally used by the graphical program to distinguish elements in the GUI, and is never shown to the user.
    * Use the "key" field to refer to element IDs when drawing flows and linkages.
    * "Key" names do not have to be descriptive and CANNOT be changed. Most key names are something like "stock1", "flow1", "flow2", etc.
    * The "label" field is shown to the user and uniquely identifies that element in the equation editor.
    * Use the "label" field to refer to the value stored in an element for use in equations.
    * "Label" fields should be descriptive and CAN be changed; however, if a label name is changed, all references to it in an equation should also be changed.
    * Use camelCase naming and avoid spaces/non-alphanumeric characters when choosing a name for both fields.
2. Stocks and Components
* Time is a global variable and cannot be directly accessed. Unless in extraordinary circumstances (i.e. direct user request), do not create a "time" element outside of modifying simulation parameters.
* Stocks Represent Accumulations: Stocks (also called levels or state variables) represent the quantity of something at a given time, such as population, money, or resources.
* Flows Represent Rates of Change: Flows (inflows and outflows) determine how stocks increase or decrease over time.
    * Flows can be uniflow or biflow.  This can be toggled by including “isNN : true”
    * The equation attached to a flow represents the flow's "draw rate", or "rate of change". This is in units/second; i.e. a flow of 100 will draw 100 units per second.
    * Each flow "draws" (reduces) a quantity from the source stock and adds that same quantity to the target stock. If biflow is enabled, this relationship can go both ways depending on the sign of the "draw rate".
    * An example of a flow relationship is one water tank draining into another water tank's volume. A flow between two stocks would be appropriate here.
    * If a "target stock" does not make sense in the context of a problem (i.e. representing change in position over time), use a "cloud" node to draw from an infinite source. In the example, a flow from a cloud to a "xPos" stock would be most appropriate.
    * Each flow has a corresponding valve; in other words, to establish a flow relationship, two components must be added. The flow component is stored as a "link" element and relates two nodes. The valve component is stored as a "node" element and contains the equation representing the rate of change. This is demonstrated in the sample JSON.
    * The equation for the flow and isNN (is non negative) are all fields in the VALVE information.  
    * A “label” field is assigned to the valve component (in nodes) and a “labelKey” field to the flow component (in links) to associate the two elements together. These two fields must be the same across the two components to be linked. This is demonstrated in the sample JSON.
* Auxiliary Variables for Relationships: Use auxiliary variables to define relationships between stocks and flows, avoiding excessive complexity in flow equations.
* Influences Show Feedback Loops Connect Stocks and Flows: Feedback loops (reinforcing or balancing) influence the dynamics of the system over time.  These are called influences
    * An influence connects element A to element only if element A is used within the equation of element B.
    * An influence can never go INTO a stock.
* Remember to use clouds: they represent unlimited sources and sinks
3. Conservation and Boundaries
* When editing a user-provided model, try to avoid changing the positions or labels of pre-existing elements unless necessary. If such a modification is made, make sure to explain why.
* Note that when changing the label of an element, all references to that element's label in an equation must also be appropriately changed. For example, if a stock's label is changed from "x" to "xPos", references to "[x]" in the equation editor must be changed to "[xPos]".
* Do not change the label of an element to an already existing element label. 
* When possible, space out elements enough to where their positions can be distinguished, but do not spread them out an unreasonable amount. Related elements should be placed next to each other when possible.
* Avoid significant overlap between element positions, especially flows and other link objects.
* Non-Negative Stocks (Where Applicable): Stocks like population or inventory should not become negative unless the context indicates that such is reasonable. Use constraints to prevent unrealistic values.
* A flow or influence should never start and stop at the same element.
4. Equations & Fields
* The label of each link and/or node element must be unique, as it serves as the identifier for that element in the equation editor. Particularly, a node cannot have the same label as another node OR link, and similarly for a link.
* Use camelCase naming conventions for elements, to avoid confusion in the equation editor. Do not use blank element labels. Spaces are permitted in node labels but are generally frowned upon.
* Examples of allowable element labels are: [xPos], [xVel], [acceleration], [counter3]
* Examples of frowned-upon element labels are: [starting velocity], [Gravity Coefficient], [123], [ ]
* ```“isNN” : true``` signifies the element is nonnegative.  This works for both stocks and flows.
* Equations must only include numbers or, if referencing another element in the model, the element label surrounded by brackets (e.g. [position]).  Please don’t include constants directly in the equations and rather use variables.
* All equations are javascript code. For example, use Math.cos() or Math.PI for cos() and PI respectively.
5. Ghosting
* When too many elements reference (and therefore have influences connected to them) another element (e.g. a variable called “gravity”), you can create a “ghost” which is just a visual copy of the element that bears some of those influences.  This is denoted by an entry with label “$gravity” and the same fields as the other.
* Note that ghost elements do not introduce new elements in the equation editor, nor do they affect the internal equations of the model; rather, they serve as visual aids in the graphical representation of the model.
6. Output Format
* The output from this conversation will be automatically parsed, so avoid using any emojis or unconventional characters outside of code blocks that may break automatic parsers.
* Comments are not permitted in JSON. Do not include comments such as ```// explanation``` in the output JSON.
* Start the response with any pertinent explanations. Then, include the entire output model as a single JSON in a code block.
* Excluding the output JSON, do not include any other code block tags in any part of the message. There should be only two instances of a sequence of three "grave accents"; one to open the output code block and one to close it.
* Do not include any messages after the output code block.
